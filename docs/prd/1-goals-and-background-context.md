# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1. Goals

The primary goals for the Zanari project are:

*   Acquire 100,000 active users within the first 12 months of launch.
*   Achieve a 70% monthly active user rate.
*   Manage KES 50 million in total user savings by the end of the first year.
*   Enable users to save an average of 5-10% of their monthly income automatically.
*   Ensure 60% of users achieve at least one of their savings goals within six months.
*   Become Kenya's leading automated savings platform by making saving effortless and integrated into daily financial life.

## 1.2. Background Context

Millions of Kenyans are active users of mobile money systems like M-PESA, but they lack structured and automated tools to build savings. The discipline required for manual saving is a significant barrier, and existing financial apps are often complex or not tailored to the savings-focused user. Mobile money platforms themselves are designed for transactions, not for fostering savings habits.

Zanari addresses this gap by providing a mobile-first application that makes saving effortless. By integrating directly with mobile money systems, it automates savings through rules like transaction round-ups. The platform provides a unified wallet, goal-tracking features, and debit card functionality to give users a comprehensive and seamless tool for building financial resilience. The initial focus is on the M-PESA ecosystem, with plans to expand.
