# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1. Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, simple, and trustworthy. The design should feel encouraging and motivating, visually celebrating the user's saving progress. The primary focus is on clarity and ease of use, ensuring users can understand their financial position at a glance and feel in control of their automated savings.

## 3.2. Key Interaction Paradigms

The application will adhere to standard mobile interaction patterns to ensure familiarity. Key paradigms will include a bottom tab navigator for primary sections, a card-based dashboard for displaying key information, and simple, guided forms for processes like goal creation. We will use subtle animations to confirm actions and celebrate milestones (e.g., reaching a savings goal).

## 3.3. Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the following conceptual screens are critical for the MVP:

*   **Onboarding & Login:** A simple, secure flow for registration and subsequent logins.
*   **Main Dashboard:** An at-a-glance view of the main wallet balance, total amount saved, and a summary of recent activity.
*   **Goal Management Screen:** A view to create new savings goals and track the progress of existing ones.
*   **Transaction History:** A detailed, searchable list of all transactions.
*   **Settings Page:** For managing the user profile, security settings (like PIN), and linked accounts.

## 3.4. Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application should meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## 3.5. Branding

Branding is to be defined. However, the visual identity should evoke feelings of security, modernity, and optimism. The color palette should be clean and professional, potentially using greens and blues to signify growth and stability, complemented by a clear, legible font.

## 3.6. Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

The application will be developed using React Native to target both Android and iOS from a single codebase, ensuring a consistent experience. A responsive web dashboard is planned for a post-MVP phase.
