```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Bottom tab bar with 3 main sections: Home (combined dashboard/analytics), Goals, History. Settings accessible via slide-out menu.

**Secondary Navigation:** Breadcrumb trail for nested screens (e.g., Goals → Goal Name → Edit Goal). Floating action button for primary actions.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Simple back navigation with contextual titles. No traditional breadcrumbs due to mobile-first design, instead using clear screen titles and back buttons.

### Screen Details and Technical Considerations

**Core Screens:**
- **Home Dashboard:** Real-time balance display, recent transactions summary, goal progress overview, basic analytics
- **Goals:** Visual goal cards with progress bars, quick actions for adding funds
- **History:** Filterable transaction list with search and categorization

**Technical IA Considerations:**
- **State Management:** Each screen maintains independent state for offline capability
- **Data Fetching:** Dashboard loads first, other screens lazy-load on navigation
- **Caching Strategy:** Transaction history cached locally, goal data synced in real-time
- **Deep Linking:** Support for direct navigation to specific goals or transactions

**User Flow Patterns:**
- **Linear Flows:** Onboarding, goal creation, M-PESA linking follow step-by-step progression
- **Hub-and-Spoke:** Dashboard serves as central hub with spokes to features
- **Tab-based Navigation:** Quick switching between primary activities without losing context

## User Flows
