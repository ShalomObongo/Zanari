# Zanari Project Conversation Documentation

## Date: 2025-09-18

## Participants
- **User**: Project stakeholder providing direction and feedback
- **Sally (UX Expert Agent)**: Completed comprehensive UI/UX specification and AI frontend prompt
- **Winston (Architect Agent)**: Documenting conversation and providing technical architecture guidance

## Project Overview
Zanari is an automated savings platform for the Kenyan market that integrates with M-PESA to help users save money effortlessly through transaction round-ups and goal-based savings.

## Conversation Summary

### Phase 1: UI/UX Specification Development
The UX Expert agent (Sally) was engaged to create a comprehensive front-end specification document for the Zanari mobile application. The specification covered:

1. **User Research & Personas**
   - Developed 4 detailed user personas representing different segments of the Kenyan market
   - Created user journey maps for key flows (onboarding, goal creation, round-up savings)

2. **Information Architecture**
   - Designed bottom tab navigation with 3 main sections: Home, Goals, History
   - Created detailed screen architectures and content hierarchies
   - Established interaction patterns and navigation flows

3. **Visual Design System**
   - Defined comprehensive design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, iconography)
   - Created component library specifications with React Native patterns
   - Established accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

4. **Technical Specifications**
   - React Native with TypeScript for cross-platform development
   - React Native Paper for UI component library
   - Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Supabase for backend services

### Phase 2: AI Frontend Prompt Generation
The user requested generation of an AI frontend prompt for development tools like Vercel v0 and Lovable.ai. The prompt included:

1. **Project Setup Instructions**
   - Monorepo structure with organized folders
   - Dependency installation guide
   - Navigation configuration

2. **Component Development Guidelines**
   - Theme system implementation
   - Reusable component specifications
   - Main screen implementations

3. **Technical Constraints**
   - React Native CLI (not Expo)
   - Mobile-only implementation
   - TypeScript requirements
   - Performance and security considerations

### User Feedback and Iterations
The user provided specific feedback to:
- Simplify the Animation & Micro-interactions section
- Contract the Accessibility Requirements section
- Streamline detailed specifications to focus on essential requirements

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (BaaS model)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Library**: React Native Paper
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with bottom tabs
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Design Decisions
- **Color Palette**: Green primary (#2E7D32) for growth, blue secondary (#1976D2) for trust
- **Typography**: Inter font family with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: 8-point grid system
- **Icons**: Material Design Icons
- **Layout**: Mobile-first, single column for mobile devices

### Integration Requirements
- **Primary Integration**: M-PESA Daraja API
- **Authentication**: Phone number + PIN
- **Payments**: M-PESA C2B transfers
- **Notifications**: In-app and push notifications

## Technical Specifications

### Core Features
1. **Automated Round-up Savings**: Calculate spare change from M-PESA transactions
2. **Goal Management**: Create and track savings goals with progress visualization
3. **Wallet Management**: View balance and transaction history
4. **M-PESA Integration**: Secure account linking and transaction processing
5. **User Authentication**: Phone number and PIN-based security

### Performance Requirements
- Load time: Under 3 seconds on standard 4G connection
- API response: Under 500ms for 95% of requests
- Concurrency: Support for 100,000+ concurrent users
- Uptime: 99.9% SLA for core services

### Security Requirements
- End-to-end encryption for all user data
- PIN-based authentication
- Secure M-PESA integration
- Compliance with Kenya Data Protection Act 2019

## Next Steps

### Recommended by Architect Agent
1. **Create Full-Stack Architecture Document**: Develop comprehensive technical architecture
2. **Implementation**: Begin React Native development using AI frontend prompt
3. **Visual Design**: Create Figma designs based on UI/UX specification
4. **Backend Setup**: Configure Supabase project and edge functions

### Immediate Actions
- Generate full-stack architecture document using `*create-full-stack-architecture` command
- Set up development environment for React Native
- Configure Supabase project and database schema
- Begin implementation of core features

## Project Status
- **Completed**: UI/UX specification, AI frontend prompt
- **In Progress**: Architecture documentation
- **Pending**: Implementation, visual design, backend setup

## Success Criteria
