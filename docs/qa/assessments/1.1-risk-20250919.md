# Risk Profile: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Story: 1.1 - Project & Backend Setup

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 52/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Supabase Service Role Key Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Environment files are often accidentally committed to repositories
**Impact**: High - Complete database access, data theft, system compromise

**Mitigation**:
- Add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .gitignore immediately
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
- Use Supabase management API instead of service keys where possible

**Testing Focus**:
- Verify .gitignore blocks service role keys
- Test that secrets are not accessible in client-side code
- Validate pre-commit hook functionality

### 2. DATA-001: Database Security Misconfiguration

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - RLS enabled but no policies defined yet
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized data access, data breaches

**Mitigation**:
- Create explicit DENY ALL policies for all tables
- Implement least-privilege access patterns
- Add security-focused integration tests
- Document RLS policy requirements

**Testing Focus**:
- Test unauthorized access attempts
- Verify RLS policies block access
- Validate admin-only access patterns

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Security Testing**
- Verify .gitignore prevents secret commits
- Test that service role keys are not exposed in client builds
- Validate RLS policies block unauthorized access
- Penetration testing of health check endpoint

**Integration Testing**
- Test database access with different user roles
- Validate environment variable loading and scoping
- Test pre-commit hook functionality

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Configuration Testing**
- Validate Nx workspace configuration across different environments
- Test Supabase local setup consistency
- Verify build and deployment processes

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Functionality Testing**
- Health check endpoint response validation
- React Native-Supabase connection tests
- Basic performance benchmarks

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical security risks (SEC-001, DATA-001)
- Service role key exposure prevention
- RLS policy implementation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Nx configuration issues (document workarounds)
- Local environment inconsistencies (provide setup scripts)

### Accepted Risks
- Performance issues in local development (acceptable for dev environment)
- Minor documentation gaps (to be addressed in subsequent stories)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Security alerts for authentication failures
- Error rates for Supabase connections
- Build success/failure rates
- Environment configuration validation

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Additional database tables are created
- New team members join
- Production deployment approaches
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered

## Risk Mitigation Details

### SEC-001: Supabase Service Role Key Exposure
```yaml
mitigation:
  risk_id: 'SEC-001'
  strategy: 'preventive'
  actions:
    - 'Add SUPABASE_*_KEY to .gitignore'
    - 'Implement pre-commit hooks for secret detection'
    - 'Use environment-specific config files'
    - 'Document secret management procedures'
  testing_requirements:
    - 'Test .gitignore effectiveness'
    - 'Verify no secrets in bundled code'
    - 'Test pre-commit hook functionality'
  residual_risk: 'Low - Human error possible but controls in place'
  owner: 'dev'
  timeline: 'Immediately'
```

### DATA-001: Database Security Misconfiguration
```yaml
mitigation:
  risk_id: 'DATA-001'
  strategy: 'preventive'
  actions:
    - 'Create explicit DENY ALL RLS policies'
    - 'Implement least-privilege database roles'
    - 'Add database security integration tests'
    - 'Document RLS policy requirements'

```

### TECH-001: Nx Monorepo Configuration
```yaml
mitigation:
  risk_id: 'TECH-001'
  strategy: 'preventive'
  actions:
    - 'Document Nx configuration requirements'
    - 'Create configuration validation scripts'

```

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. **Security First**: Focus on preventing secret exposure and unauthorized access
2. **Configuration Validation**: Ensure consistent environments across team
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate all components work together

### Development Focus
1. **Security by Design**: Implement security controls from the start
2. **Documentation**: Create clear setup and configuration guides
3. **Automation**: Use scripts to ensure consistent environments

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Environment Parity**: Ensure local/dev/staging environments match
2. **Secret Management**: Implement proper secret handling from day one
3. **Incremental Rollout**: Test each component before full integration
