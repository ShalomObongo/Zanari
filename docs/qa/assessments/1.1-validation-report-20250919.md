## Quality Assessment

### Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Exceptional security foundation (critical for fintech)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive technical context
- ‚úÖ Clear, actionable tasks
- ‚úÖ Source-verified technical claims
- ‚úÖ Proactive QA integration
- ‚úÖ Risk mitigation already implemented

**Minor Improvements:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Story still in Draft status (should be Approved/InProgress)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tasks partially completed (security fixes)
- üí° Could benefit from explicit dependency mapping

### Confidence Level: HIGH

**Rationale:**
- Critical security risks proactively addressed
